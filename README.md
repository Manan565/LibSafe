# üìö Library Security System

A real-time webcam-based security system that monitors students' personal belongings in libraries and sends instant SMS notifications when items are moved or taken. Built with React, Flask, OpenCV, and Twilio.


##  Features

- **Real-time Object Detection**: Uses YOLOv3 to detect and track personal belongings
- **Movement Alerts**: Instant notifications when items are moved or taken
- **User Authentication**: Secure registration and login system
- **Webcam Integration**: Browser-based camera access for monitoring
- **SMS Notifications**: Twilio integration for instant alerts
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Robust data storage for users and monitoring sessions
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices


## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React 18** with Vite
- **Axios** for API calls
- **HTML5 Canvas** for webcam frame capture
- **CSS3** with custom styling

### Backend
- **Flask** Python web framework
- **PostgreSQL** database with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **OpenCV** for computer vision
- **YOLOv3** for object detection
- **Twilio API** for SMS notifications
- **JWT** for authentication
- **bcrypt** for password hashing

## üìã Prerequisites
